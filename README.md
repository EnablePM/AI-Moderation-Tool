Stuff that needs to be done:

- user email whitelist + matching functions (I recommend doing this so we can create the whitelist of emails sooner rather than later)
- schema structures (model should be created just check for more info needed)
- api testing
- migrating routes from frontend to backend for security (mostly done)
- 
- otherstuff i cant think of right now
